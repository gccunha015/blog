## Computational Thinking
General hability of optimizing the process of solving a problem and improving the solution. It is based on 4 pillars:
* Decomposition : divide a problem in smaller problems
* Pattern recognition : find similarities between problems
* Abstraction : identify main characteristics of a problem and use them to find the solution that may be used for similar problems
* Algorithm desing : determine steps for a solution of a problem

Some complementary abilities are needed to take advantage of computational thinking, those being:
* Logical thinking : define a structure to solve a problem
* Improvement : improve an existing solution
