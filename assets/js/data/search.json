It is based on 4 pillars: Decomposition : divide a problem in smaller problems Pattern recognition : find similarities between problems Abstraction : identify main characteristics of a problem and use them to find the solution that may be used for similar problems Algorithm desing : determine steps for a solution of a problemSome complementary abilities are needed to take advantage of computational thinking, those being: Logical thinking : define a structure to solve a problem Improvement : improve an existing solutionIntroduction to progamming logic" } ]
